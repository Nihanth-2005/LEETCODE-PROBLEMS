#Brute force approach

class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1,len(nums)):
                if nums[i]+nums[j]==target:
                    return [i,j]




#Optimized one-pass approach

class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        seen = {}
        for i,num in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - num
            if diff in seen:
                return [seen[diff], i]
            seen[num]=i

-> In this optimized approach, we keep track of a dictionary, wich in turn keeps track of differences of nums
